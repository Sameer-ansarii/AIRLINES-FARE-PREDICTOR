# Flight Fare Prediction using Linear Regression
This project is aimed at predicting the fare of Indian aviation company flights using linear regression. The dataset used for this project was obtained from [Kaggle] and it contains various features such as airline, source, destination, and duration, among others.

# INTRODUCTION
The objective of the study is to analyse the flight booking dataset obtained from “Ease My Trip” website and to conduct various statistical hypothesis tests in order to get meaningful information from it. The 'Linear Regression' statistical algorithm would be used to train the dataset and predict a continuous target variable. 'Easemytrip' is an internet platform for booking flight tickets, and hence a platform that potential passengers use to buy tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers.

# Research Questions
The aim of our study is to answer the below research questions:
a) Does price vary with Airlines?
b) How is the price affected when tickets are bought in just 1 or 2 days before departure?
c) Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
d) How the price changes with change in Source and Destination?
e) How does the ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?

# Problem Statement
An airline is a company that provides air transport services for traveling passengers and freight. Airlines use aircraft to supply these services and may form partnerships or alliances with other airlines for codeshare agreements, in which they both offer and operate the same flight. Generally, airline companies are recognized with an air operating certificate or license issued by a governmental aviation body. Airlines may be scheduled or charter operators.

Airlines assign prices to their services in an attempt to maximize profitability. The pricing of airline tickets has become increasingly complicated over the years and is now largely determined by computerized yield management systems.

The price of an Airline Ticket is affected by a number of factors, such as flight duration, days left for departure, arrival time and departure time etc. Airline organizations may diminish the cost at the time they need to build the market and at the time when the tickets are less accessible. They may maximize the costs. The price may rely upon different factors. Each factor has its own proprietary rules and algorithms to set the price accordingly. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) makes it possible to infer such rules and model the price variation.
